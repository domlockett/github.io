## Purpose

- Explain the basics of Python as it is used for data analysis.

--

- Provide an overview of the skills necessary to conduct sufficient analyses in probability and inference.

--

- Demonstrate how to calculate basic measures of frequency and association in Python.

--

- Demonstrate the appropriate methods to use based on the type of data you are managing for descriptive and inferential interpretation (continuous, categorical, count data).

--

- Explain the various methods one can use for inference (linear regression, logit regression, duration models, naive bayes) in the Python environment.

--

- Demonstrate how data can be displayed using Python's available plotting tools.

## Online learning

- As with most courses offered this summer, this was meant to be a face-to-face lecture.

- Teaching coding skills remotely is often difficult, however, my previous experience during the Spring gave me some experience with our current online learning accommodations.

---
### Lectures

- All lectures will be pre-recorded.

    - While this is self-paced given the additional challenges that occur when working from home, it is still expected that you review lectures prior to that day's syncronous session. 
    
--

- Lectures will be made available on the Canvas course page.

--

- Typically the lectures will last between 60-90 minutes. 

---
### Lectures

- Each days lecture will be split up into multiple sections with an activity focusing on the section's topic at the end.

--

  - Example: Today's lecture is split up into three videos.
     1. This is the first in which we go over the goals and expectations of the class and there will be no activity.
      2. The next section will briefly describe how to download Python, JupyterLab and GitHub. There is no formal activity, ut you will need to download the software to proceed.
      3. Then we will get your Python environment running and the activity will be demonstrating you have Python and Jupyter functioning.
     4. The final section will cover a wide variety of Python basics and the activity will ask you to create your own file executing basic functions in Python.

--
- You will need to understand JupyterLab and GitHub a bit to better understand the activities.
    

---
### Live sessions

- You will need to have [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) installed on your device to participate in the live sessions. 

--

- These sessions will serve as office hours in which we can overcome issues you had executing the class activities. 

--

- These will last no more than 90 minutes; the length of the live meeting will be entirely dependent on your needs as a class. 

--

- 10% of your grade.
    
--

- All activities will ask you to share questions you have during the lecture with me so that our live time together can be the most productive for everyone in attendance.

--
- All live sessions will be recorded so that students can review content. Recordings will be posted on the Canvas course page. 

---
## Course overview

### Class content

1. Setting up your Python environment and exploring the fundamental features of Python.

--

2. Learn to import and transform data to suite your analyses and learn how to collect new datasets using web scraping.

--

3. Go over the basics of descriptive and inferential data analysis in Python and how to make simple graphical interpretations.

--
4. A deeper look into data visualization based on one's particular needs (single-variable, multi-variable, time-series).

--

5. Explore natural language processing and machine learning in Python.

---
### Assigments

- This course will consist of three factors:

    1. In-class activities (20% of Grade)

    2. Quizzes (40% of grade)

    3. Final Project (40% of grade)

---
### Activities

- On your own time, you will be expected to watch the pre-recorded lectures and complete all the activities. Submission of activities will serve as evidence of participation. 10% of your participation grade.

--

- While this is self-paced, you should be watching this daily prior to the synchronous meetings in order to take advantage of the daily 'office hours'.

--

- Activities will be uploaded through GitHub.

---

### Quizzes


- After each live session I will distribute a quiz asking students to demonstrate their understanding of the day's content.

--

- Quizzes will be distributed and submitted on Github.

--

- Students are allowed to work with one another. However, each keystroke in your script should be your own. No copy and pasting someone else's solution.

---

### Final Project

     
- The final assignment will be a problem set which will ask the students to demonstrate the skills they have learned throughout the course.

--

- The assignment is open-note, open-web, but each assignment should be completed without collaboration with other students.
---

## The rest of today's Lecture

### Getting Started: Python, Jupyter Notebook, and Github

- Where to find the software and how to install it.

--

### Assignment 0

- Getting your class materials together and how to use JupyterLab and GitHub.

--

### Assignment 1-1

- A couple of small tasks to illustrate how you will be using JupyterLab and GitHub to turn in your assignments.
